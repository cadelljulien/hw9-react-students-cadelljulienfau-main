Homework 9 claims it spot as the hardest homework to complete. Utlized ChatGPT and stackoverflow bbut still had a hard time trying to get things running. I would say the harderst parts were the get methods. Where you would've had to display the student or stuends in a proper table format. But overall good things to know and learn from it.
